- 👋 Hi, I’m @mutuaeric
- 👀 I’m interested in mechanical engeneering, embedded systems and software programing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning software engeneering through an enroled ALX-SE program and a bachelors degree computer science student hopping to graduate in 2024 from Tharaka University.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any field based on hardware and system development.
- 📫 Reach me via my linkedin
